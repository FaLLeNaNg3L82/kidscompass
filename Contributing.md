> **Subject**: Seeking volunteer help for KidsCompass (open source child‑contact tracker)
>
> Hi everyone,
>
> I’m the creator of **KidsCompass**, an open‑source tool to track and visualize child‑contact schedules. I’m currently going through a difficult divorce, and due to limited access arranged by my ex‑partner, I need a reliable, persistent, and statistically rigorous way to log visits with my children. This data is crucial for upcoming court proceedings.
>
> So far, I’ve built a Qt UI with scheduling, overrides (e.g., holidays), and basic reports. I’m now working on:
>
> * Full SQLite persistence (patterns, overrides, visit status)
> * SQL backup & restore
> * Advanced stats queries (weekday trends, split by child)
> * Automatic PDF reporting with charts
>
> I could really use guidance or pair‑programming on any of these features, especially:
>
> * Database schema design for future extensibility
> * Reliable export/import of SQL
> * Generating dynamic queries
> * Integrating PDF/chart generation smoothly
>
> If you have experience in Python, Qt (PySide6), SQLite, or reporting/visualization, I’d love to collaborate. No paid contract—just a fellow open‑source enthusiast aiming to help parents stay connected with their kids.
