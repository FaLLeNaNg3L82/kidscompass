## KidsCompass Roadmap (English Translation)

This document summarizes the major upcoming tasks and can be tracked/versioned in the Git repository.

**1. Persistence Model**

* Remove JSON files; store all patterns, overrides, and visit status in SQLite.
* Implement a clear DAO interface in `data.py`.
* Migration tool: import existing JSON data into the database.

**2. Reporting Tab**

* Extended PDF layouts (cover page, tables).
* Chart integration directly in the UI (mini-preview).
* Support for multiple chart types (line, bar, heatmap).

**3. Advanced Statistics Queries**

* Wednesday absence reports (filter by weekday).
* Trend analysis over time (e.g., rolling averages).
* Frequency distribution by weekdays vs. weekends.
* Export statistics as CSV/Excel.

**4. Test Coverage**

* Unit tests for all DB functions (`data.py`).
* UI tests (e.g., with `pytest-qt`) for tab interactions.
* Quick integration tests (PDF/chart generation).

**5. Linting & Formatting**

* Configure Black as code formatter.
* Use `isort` for import sorting.
* `flake8` for static linting.
* Pre-commit hook automation.

**6. Workflow & Git Best Practices**

* Setup GitHub Projects / Issues and link them.
* Define a branching model (Git Flow / trunk-based).
* Automate release tagging (CI/CD).

- Contributors interested in enhancing the Reporting and Statistics features (charts, PDF layouts, trend analysis).
- Help setting up CI/CD, linting (Black, isort, flake8), and automated tests (`pytest-qt`).

Thank you!
